# toolchains_emscripten

The goal of this repository is to make it possible to build executables and static and shared libraries using the Emscripten toolchain from inside of Bazel. In addition to being compatible with the functions from `rules_cc`, it is a goal to support all build systems and configurations which are provided via `rules_foreign_cc`.
